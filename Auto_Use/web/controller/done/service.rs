//! Run completion.

//! `done` touches nothing in the browser — its whole job is to hand the loop
//! the final summary and the one field that ends the run. That field is
//! `action == "done"`: the agent loop breaks on it, records the summary as
//! the run's outcome and pairs it as the last tool result, so it must be
//! present and spelled exactly that way or the loop keeps going.
//!
//! The summary is never dropped or defaulted away silently — it is what the
//! user and the next resumed session both read as "what happened".
