OCR Detection — macOS Apple Vision OCR scanner.

Mirrors the Windows OCRScanner (windows/tree/ocr_detection.py): captures
nothing itself — it OCRs a PRE-CAPTURED screen image so it shares the exact
frame the AX scan + annotation use — and returns a raw line list. Filtering /
merging against the AX element tree happens in the caller (element.py).

Talks to Vision directly rather than through ocrmac, because ocrmac's entry
point PNG-encodes the image (pil2buf -> Image.save(format="PNG")) just for
Vision to decode it again. This scanner takes the CGImage the screenshot
already produced and hands it straight to VNImageRequestHandler. That matters
for more than the encode time: this runs on a worker thread beside the AX
walk, and every byte of Python/PIL work it does holds the GIL against that
walk. Measured on a full-screen capture, OCR cost inside a live scan dropped
from 0.71s to well under half that.

Designed to run as a parallel thread alongside the AX walk. The returned line
boxes are already converted to CG/AX POINTS (top-left origin) so they live in
the same coordinate space as AX element rects.
