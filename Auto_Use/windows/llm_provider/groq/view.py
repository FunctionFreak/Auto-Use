# Model mappings for Groq provider
# Maps user-friendly names to actual API model names

# One model only. Qwen3.6-27B is the sole Groq model that carries every
# capability this loop needs at once — Groq lists it as "Tool Use, JSON Object
# Mode, Reasoning, Vision", and it is the ONLY vision model Groq serves at
# all. gpt-oss-120b was dropped because it is text-only, which cannot answer a
# driver step that hands the model a screenshot.
#
# Reasoning is deliberately left unset: the model has thinking and
# non-thinking modes, and with no reasoning field on the request it keeps
# Groq's own default. Temperature is handled once in service.py (0.2).
#
# Caveat worth keeping in view: Groq classes this as a PREVIEW model —
# "intended for evaluation purposes only... may be discontinued at short
# notice" — and Groq has retired preview models before (kimi-k2-instruct in
# March 2026, qwen3-32b in June). With one entry there is nothing left to fall
# back to on this provider if that happens.
