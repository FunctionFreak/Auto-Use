Manual test harness for element.py.

Runs a 5-second countdown, then drives the same three-call sequence the agent
uses in production (scan_elements -> save_to_file -> get_scan_data) with
DEBUG force-enabled, so the element tree and annotated screenshot are written
to debug/element/ and debug/screenshot/ under the current working directory.

Run from the repo root:
    python -m Auto_Use.windows.tree.test
