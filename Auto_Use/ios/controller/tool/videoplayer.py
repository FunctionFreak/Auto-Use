"""
videoplayer.py - Full-screen video playback control via WebDriverAgent.

DRM-protected players black out screenshots, so the agent cannot see the
video surface. This service works from the accessibility source instead.

Facts established live against Sky Go on an iPhone (26.6.1), which shape
everything below:

  * The transport buttons stay in the accessibility tree - with visible=true -
    even while the overlay is VISUALLY hidden. Tree presence proves nothing
    about what is on screen.
  * Coordinate taps at a button's own centre are eaten by the player's
    screen-covering gesture layer ("Double tap to show controls") and merely
    toggle the overlay. That layer is exactly why the old tap-at-(x,y) code
    "tapped the screen, showed the icons, and never played or paused".
  * WDA ELEMENT clicks actuate a control only when it is really shown;
    clicking the gesture-layer element is the reliable way to reveal the
    overlay. Reveal + element-click is the sequence that actually paused and
    played the content on the device.
  * The transport button's NAME tracks true playback state: the tree holds
    pauseButton while playing and playButton while paused, overlay hidden or
    not. That is the state check. The progress label ("You've watched N
    Minutes M Seconds") advancing is the ground truth for the streaming check.
