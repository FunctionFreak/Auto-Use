"""ConversationService — permanent, resumable chat memory for the UI path.

This is the ONE place that knows how a chat is persisted, optimized and
replayed. app.py is thin glue:

    sid, prior = conversation.start_or_resume(session_id, task)   # load
    agent = AgentService(..., prior_history=prior)                # trigger
    agent.process_request(task)
    conversation.save_run(sid, agent.assistant_messages,          # save
                          agent.tool_responses, status, message, task)

On-disk layout — data lives OUTSIDE the install folder, so uninstalling the app
can never destroy the user's chats (the Windows installer uninstalls with
`[UninstallDelete] Type: filesandordirs; Name: "{app}"`, i.e. it deletes the
WHOLE install directory, and chats used to be written inside it):

    <home>/autouse_data/agent_conversation/     (packaged build)
    <repo>/autouse_data/agent_conversation/     (python app.py)
        index.json                      <- { id: {title, created_at,
                                              updated_at, last_done_message} }
        settings.json                   <- last-used provider/model (frontend)
        <session_id>/conversation.json  <- one folder per session: the
                                           optimized, resumable history snapshot

There is exactly ONE of these for the whole app — windows, mac and
ios all route their memory through this single service — so this one root
is every platform's chat store.

The saved history is the agent's FULL per-step memory: each assistant step with
its thinking / eval / decision / memory / next_goal / action intact, paired 1:1
with the agent's already-compacted tool results, and capped with a single
"terminal note" step carrying a clean done-message so a resumed run always knows
how the previous run ended — on EVERY ending (done, user stop, error, provider
kill, step limit, parse fails). Storing the FULL steps (not a trimmed copy) is
deliberate: the debug download (render_readable) is then the TRUE agent memory,
readable like main.py's conversation_N.txt. Resume token-efficiency is
unaffected — the agent's OWN message builder trims older steps to
decision/memory/next_goal when it sends them to the LLM.

It contains NO system prompt and NO screenshot bytes, so a resumed run never
double-loads the system prompt: the agent's message builder always prepends
exactly one system message and seeds these two lists underneath it. (The debug
log adds the system prompt for readability only, supplied by app.py at export.)
