//! Tab handling — every tab tool lives here.
//!
//! They are separate tools to the model because they are separate intents.
//! Underneath they are the same concern: which tab the agent is pointed at,
//! and what that tab is showing.
//!
//! Two wires, both owned by the browser side and borrowed here:
//!   - the CDP session, for moving a tab (navigate, reload, history);
//!   - Chrome's HTTP endpoint, for tab lifecycle (open, close). Tabs are
//!     created and closed over /json/* and nowhere else, so one list — the one
//!     <all_tabs> is rendered from — decides what [n] means.
