"""CompressionController — runtime orchestration for the handoff compression
agent (sibling agent/service.py builds the dump and makes the LLM call).

The compression agent is its OWN agent: everything about WHEN it fires, HOW
the worker runs, and HOW the result is spliced back lives here, in ONE place
shared by all platform agents (mac / ios / windows). A platform
agent wires it with four hooks, all called from its main loop:

    reset()          — at the top of process_request (invalidates stale workers)
    maybe_trigger()  — right after each main-agent LLM call (last_usage fresh)
    apply_pending()  — at the top of each loop iteration (splices IN PLACE)
    finish_run()     — after the loop exits (stops a dangling indicator)

The CODER agent reuses this same controller with two constructor callables
(dump_builder / synthetic_entry) that swap the main-agent history format for
its native tool-calling one; trigger/threading/splice orchestration is shared.

Threading contract (unchanged from the original in-agent version): the dump is
snapshotted on the CALLER's thread; the daemon worker makes one plain-text LLM
call and only deposits {gen, k, text}; every list mutation happens inside
apply_pending, i.e. on the main loop's thread. A generation counter makes
stale results (from a previous run on the same instance) unappliable.
