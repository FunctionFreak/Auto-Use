"""Browser-agent fallback for the `web` tool.

Providers with no native web-search API (Together AI) still have to honour
the `web` action — Structure.md requires every provider to. This hands the
query to the browser agent (Auto_Use/web, the Rust/CDP Chrome driver) running
on the SAME provider+model, waits for it, and returns its `done` summary as
the web result. The task text below is what turns that summary into a proper
report rather than a one-line activity log.

Runs the browser agent as a subprocess (mirrors agent_launcher's parallel
runner and the minion await loop) rather than in-process, because:
  * the web AgentService constructor deletes CWD-relative conversation/,
    debug/ and raw_reasoning/ — the mac agent's LIVE folders — so the child
    gets its own working directory;
  * the child owns its own headless Chrome on a DEDICATED port, never the
    visible one a `web use` run may have left on the default port — a visible
    browser popping up would corrupt the desktop agent's screenshots;
  * a stop request or wall-clock timeout only has to terminate a process.

<research_request>
{query}
</research_request>

How to work:
- Open a search engine via `update_tab` (https://www.google.com — if it shows a consent/captcha wall use https://duckduckgo.com or https://www.bing.com) and visit several credible sources: official sites, primary documents, reputable news/reference sites. Cross-check key facts across at least two sources when possible.
- Record every key finding (numbers, dates, names, exact URLs) in the scratchpad as you go so nothing is lost.
- Read only: never log in, sign up, buy, download, or change anything.

How to finish — THIS IS THE DELIVERABLE:
- Your final `done` call's value MUST BE THE ANSWER ITSELF as a detailed, well-formatted Markdown report — NOT a summary of the actions you took.
- Structure: a title line, `##` headings and `###` subheadings per sub-topic, `-` bullets, and the key numbers/facts/quotes stated explicitly. Go in depth where the request needs it; keep it brief where it doesn't.
- End with a `## Sources` section listing the URLs you actually used.
- If something could not be found, say so explicitly instead of guessing.
