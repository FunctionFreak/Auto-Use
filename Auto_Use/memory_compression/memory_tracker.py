"""MemoryTracker — current memory fullness for the MAIN agent's bar.

The bar answers "how full is the MAIN agent's working memory right now?", NOT
"how many tokens have we burned in total". Every turn the agent rebuilds and
re-sends its whole (trimmed) context, and the provider reports the true size of
that exact prompt. We show that latest size against a FIXED budget — MEMORY_CAP
(300k) — so the bar rises as history grows and DROPS when the runtime memory
optimization (stripping old images / element trees) kicks in.

The cap is fixed on purpose, NOT the model's context window: a future
memory-compression system will keep the agent's real context under this budget,
so 300k is the headroom gauge for it.

`context_tokens` is the full prompt size INCLUDING cached tokens — a cache-read
token still occupies memory, so it counts whether it was cached or not (see
LLMManager._normalize_usage). Only the main agent is tracked; CLI / coder /
minion sub-agents run on their own LLMManager and never feed this bar. On reopen
the caller seeds `initial_context` from the chat's last saved value.

    unclamped token count, and only the bar's `pct` saturates at 100% so a full
