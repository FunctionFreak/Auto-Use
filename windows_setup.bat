::  Installs uv, creates venv\, installs windows_requirements.txt into it,
::  installs the Interception kernel driver, and reboots. Platform-shared files
::  (main.py, cli.py, frontend/index.html, frontend/script.js) detect the OS at
::  runtime, so no file patching is needed - one checkout runs on both macOS
::  and Windows as-is.
::
::  uv (https://astral.sh/uv) replaces the old "go install Python 3.13 from
::  python.org yourself, remember to tick Add to PATH, then come back and
::  re-run me" dead end: it uses a Python already on this machine, or downloads
::  one itself. It also replaces pip for the install below - same PyPI
::  packages, much faster, and it resolves the whole tree at once instead of
::  one package at a time. MacOS_setup.sh is uv-based for the same reasons;
::  this keeps the two platforms on one toolchain.

:: --- 1. Admin self-elevation ---
:: Relaunch through "cmd /k" instead of handing this .bat to Start-Process
:: directly. Shell-executing a .bat runs it under "cmd /c", so the console dies
:: the moment the script exits - including on every error path - and takes the
:: message you needed to read with it. All you see in the parent shell is
:: "Requesting Administrator privileges..." and a window that blinks out of
:: existence. /k keeps that window up however the run ends.
