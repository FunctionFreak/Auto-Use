# `thinking_level` is Gemini 3's thinking control — a named level, not a token
# budget (thinking_budget is the older field and is not what these models
# want). The SDK carries it as types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level=...), built
# in service.py so this table stays plain data; the value is coerced
# case-insensitively, so "low" here is the same as the enum's LOW.
#
# Both models are pinned to `low`, but it means a different thing on each,
# because their ladders and defaults differ:
#   gemini-3.1-pro-preview  low/medium/high          default high    -> floor
#   gemini-3.6-flash        minimal/low/medium/high  default medium  -> one
#                                                                      above
#                                                                      floor
# Neither default was cheap: Pro would otherwise run at `high`, the top of its
# range, on every step.
#
# The `-vertex` entries are the SAME models reached through a different
# client — Vertex AI keeps the bare model ID rather than renaming it — so
# api_name is intentionally duplicated across each pair. Only `vertex`
# differs, which is what picks the client in service.py.

    Keyed by api_name, matching the same helper in the other providers.

    NOTE the difference from those providers: api_name is NOT unique here.
    Each model appears twice, once as itself and once as its `-vertex` twin,
    since Vertex AI serves the same model ID through a different client. That
    is safe only while both halves of a pair carry the same level, which they
    do — first match wins. If a pair ever needs to differ between AI Studio
    and Vertex, this has to key on the short name instead.

    None for an unregistered model, so a hand-typed name keeps Google's own
    default rather than being handed a level its ladder may not include —
    `minimal`, for instance, does not exist on Pro.
