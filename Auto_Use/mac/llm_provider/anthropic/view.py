# Sampling knobs for the models that still accept them — only Haiku now.
# `temperature` is never sent: the frontier models removed it (400
# "`temperature` is deprecated for this model"), and one knob steers better
# than two anyway. top_p does the real work — it holds generation to the
# confident mass, which is what keeps tool-call arguments and schema JSON
# well-formed. top_k is only a tail guard: it bites when the distribution is
# unusually flat and otherwise never binds.

# Thinking, for the models that take it. ADAPTIVE means Claude decides per
# request whether to think and for how long, rather than being handed a fixed
# token budget; it is the only mode the 5-series accepts, and the old
# budget form (thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}) is a 400
# there. `effort` is the dial on top: how deep that thinking may go and how
# much the model spends overall.
#
# Levels, cheapest to deepest: low | medium | high | xhigh | max. Opus 5 and
# Sonnet 5 both accept all five and both DEFAULT TO high, so omitting effort
# is not neutral — it is the second-most-expensive setting. Each entry states
# its level for that reason.
#
# `low` also keeps this loop honest about max_tokens: thinking tokens are
# billed against the same 4000-token ceiling as the visible answer and the
# tool-call JSON, and the loop runs tool_choice {"type": "any"}, so a turn
# that spends its budget thinking loses the tool call it owed.
