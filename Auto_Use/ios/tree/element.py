#
# Two independent caps, both orientation-agnostic:
#   MAX_EDGE   - the long side. Device screenshots are tall (e.g. 1170x2532),
#                so this is what binds on phones. Vision models resize anything
#                larger themselves, which would put the annotations through
#                THEIR resampler and undo the crisp-label work.
#   MAX_PIXELS - a total-area budget, since models also cap by token count
#                (~750px per image token).

# JPEG, not PNG — matching mac/tree/element.py. The lossless PNG payload ran
# multiple MB of base64 per step, and since the screenshot rides the live
# (never-cached) message, that upload was paid in full on EVERY step — it
# dominated LLM latency. Image tokens bill by DIMENSIONS not bytes, so the
# model reads the same tokens either way; the bytes only cost upload time. The
# reason PNG was chosen — chroma subsampling storing colour at half resolution
# and smearing the thin magenta labels — is answered by SUBSAMPLING = 0
# (4:4:4) below: full-resolution chroma keeps the annotation digits crisp at
# roughly a tenth of the bytes.

# deadline of its own. The read budget is generous — /source is linear in the

# request (3.60s -> 0.66s when excluded); `accessible` costs a further 15%.
# Every other attribute — label, name, value, enabled, index — measured free.
#
# Because /source is almost exactly linear in element count (fitted at 9.7ms
# per node with ~0.00s fixed overhead), and these two attributes are nearly
# all of that slope, dropping them collapses the request:
#     home 3.62s -> 0.39s | Settings 1.44 -> 0.22 | Messages 0.54 -> 0.11

# is tall, so MAX_EDGE binds on the long side and the frame arrives ~1060x2300 —
# roughly 2.7 delivered pixels per iOS point. At 13px the digits landed under 5

        Runs on a worker started before GET /source. How much actually overlaps

        HTTP": WDA serves requests from a single XCTest queue, so this

        while the main thread was finishing. Net 0.15-0.4s per scan depending
        on screen density.

        The pixel work is safe to background only because the main thread is
        parked in recv() (no GIL, no bytecode) while it runs. Beside a CPU-BUSY
        thread PNG decode degrades 14x — it re-acquires the GIL per 64KB chunk
        and loses every 5ms switch — which is the same effect that got
        mac's glyph pre-render reverted. If /source ever drops below
        ~0.45s these two would start colliding.
