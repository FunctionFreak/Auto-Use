# WebDriverAgent one-shot signer + runner.
#
# Layout expected (put this file and the html/ folder next to a fresh WDA clone):
#
#   WebDriverAgent/                <- you clone this here, untouched
#   html/index.html                <- the UI
#   setup.py                       <- run this
#
# What it does when you hit Connect in the browser:
#   1. validates team id / device / project
#   2. rewrites WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (Automatic signing, team, bundle ids)
#      -> exactly the three targets you set by hand: Lib, Runner, IntegrationApp
#   3. mounts the developer disk image (pymobiledevice3, best effort)
#   4. runs xcodebuild with -allowProvisioningUpdates  (this IS the "Test" click)
#   5. streams every line back to the page, live
#
# Not handled here (one-time, already done, lives outside the project file):
#   Apple ID signed into Xcode, phone trusted, Developer Mode on.
#
# Free-account reality: the profile expires every 7 days. The fix is just re-running
# this. No UI, ever. `test` mode stays running once the WDA server is up -- that is
# success; use Stop to end it. `build only` mode exits cleanly on a good build.
